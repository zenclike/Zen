To install the Zen compiler, you need to have gcc compiler.
Then you need to run ./build.sh in the terminal.
Now, you have the Zen compiler (zenc) in the bin folder!
If you want to make the Zen compiler global, run
source global.sh in the terminal.

from your operating system, run ./remove.sh in the terminal.
